I modified these .stls to fix minor gripes and/or add heatsets.

## Ender 5 LCD Mount

Based on the work of [DanAnderson](https://www.printables.com/model/79183-fysetc-and-bigtreetech-12864-mini-display-case-wit) on Printables. Mounting points have been widened to allow for heatsets, and the mounting points on the back have been moved downwards as well. I also added a tab button above the reset button. attachment arms left unmodified but included for postarity. *Licensed under the Creative Commons (4.0 International License) - Attribution*.

## Filament Runout Sensor Housing

Based on the work of [Solomoriah](https://www.printables.com/model/293537-creality-filament-runout-sensor-housing) on Printables. Mounting points for the switch have been moved backwards about 0.75mm, because when tightened the switch was to close to the tube, so the switch was always depressed.  *Licensed under the Creative Commons (4.0 International License) - Attribution*.

# Euclid Dock

Based on the work of [nionio6915](https://github.com/nionio6915/Euclid_Probe) on Github. The was modified from the fixed dock to mount from below instead of from the front, because of clearance issues due to the bed. *Licensed under the Creative Commons (4.0 International) Attribution - NonCommercial - ShareAlike*.
